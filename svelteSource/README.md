If you have already installed all the necessary packages in  [First start](#first-start) section, to build just run:
```cmd
cd ./svelteSource
npm run build
cd ../
```
> If you are in vscode, you can run build from npm scripts menu

```cmd
cd ./svelteSource
npm install
npm run build
cd ../
```

```cmd
cd ./svelteSource
